[Efficacy of Single-Dose and Triple-Dose Albendazole and Mebendazole against Soil-Transmitted Helminths and Taenia spp.: A Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181256/)

Single-dose oral albendazole is more efficacious against hookworm than mebendazole. To achieve high CRs against both hookworm and T. trichiura, triple-dose regimens are warranted.

[Single-dose Albendazole 400 mg Effectiveness in Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura Infections](https://www.ajouronline.com/index.php/AJAS/article/view/5915)

After giving a single dose of albendazole 400 mg to 37 people who were positive for Ascaris lumbricoides, 37 people had not found eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides on faecal examination after treatment. Positive subjects Trichuris trichiura were 54 people (mild infections 51.85%, moderate infections 44.44% and severe infections 3.73%). After giving a single dose of albendazole 400 mg to 54 positive people Trichuris trichiura, in severe infections, the percentage of eggs dropped was 100%. In moderate infections, the percentage of the number of eggs dropped is 95.83%. In mild infections, the percentage of total recovery was 7.14%, and the percentage of eggs dropped was 39.29%. 


[Albendazole, an effective single dose, broad spectrum anthelmintic drug](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6625078/)

Albendazole, a new anthelmintic drug was evaluated in Malaysia in 91 patients, with single or mixed infections of Ascaris, Trichuris, and hookworm. Albendazole was administered as a single dose of 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg. The cure rate for Ascaris at all three doses was 100% at days 14 and 21 post-treatment; for hookworm it was 98.8%, 100% and 98%, respectively, at day 14 and 68.8%, 100% and 84%, respectively, at day 21; for Trichuris it was 31.2%, 57.1% and 42.3%, respectively, at day 14 and 27.3%, 60.9% and 48.0%, respectively, at day 21. The egg reduction rate at day 21 was 100% at all three doses for Ascaris, 94.5%, 100% and 96.1%, respectively, for hookworm; and 39.2%, 85.1% and 72.8%, respectively, for Trichuris. There were no side effects, and biochemical examination of blood and urine did not indicate any unfavourable changes. Based on this trial, the recommended dosage for Ascaris and hookworm is a 400 mg single dose, and for Trichuris is a 600 mg single dose. Albendazole appears to be more effective than other available anthelmintic drugs.
