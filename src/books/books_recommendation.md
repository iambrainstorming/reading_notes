# What curriculum should students have in high school?

What curriculum should students have in high school? Our schools are somewhat good at primary education. During primary education, children can spend most of their time socializing and playing, while also improving their numerical and language skills to prepare for high school. However, when it comes to high school and higher education, the complexity of the subjects increases, requiring a more logical and analytical problem-solving approach.

By high school, I mean from 8th grade to 12th grade, take it as a period of 5-8 years.

I prefer to consider these years as a continuum, instead of changing books every year and repeating and expanding the same subjects annually. The same books can be taught for 5 to 8 years, with chapter-wise tests every month.


### STEM education 

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics should be given more importance to prepare students for future careers in these fields. This includes offering more specialized courses and encouraging students to participate in STEM competitions and projects.

### Social Sciences

Social sciences should be an essential part of the high-school curriculum. Adding social sciences as a point in the curriculum can help students develop a deeper understanding of human behavior, social structures, and cultural practices.

## Literature
They not only help students develop their language and communication skills but also provide insights into human experiences, cultures, and values.

### Soft skills

In addition to academic subjects, high schools should also emphasize soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These skills are essential for success in any field and can help students navigate the challenges of higher education and the workplace.

### Mental health and well-being

High schools should prioritize mental health and well-being by offering counseling services, mindfulness training, and mental health education. This can help students cope with stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues that can impact their academic performance and overall well-being.


## Book or Curriculum Recommendation

I recommend using all the books from [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) or compiling their subject matter from other books. OpenStax books are open-source, so you can access all of them for free.

From philosophy and world history to physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics, OpenStax has all kinds of books that are needed for high school students.

Some other books recommendation:

### Biology:

Jane B Reece, Lisa A Urry, Michael L Cain, Peter V Minorsky, Steven A Wasserman: Campbell Biology 
Benjamin Pierce: Genetics A Conceptual Approach
Martini, Frederic H: Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology
Bruce Alberts  et al Essential cell biology 
Robert F. Weaver-Molecular Biology
Judy Owen, Jenni Punt, Sharon Stranford: Kuby Immunology 


### Mathematics
Gary L Musser, William F Burger, Blake E Peterson: Mathematics for elementary teachers a contemporary approach
Openstax Mathematics and MOOCs from Edx or Coursera
Calculus - James Stewart
Mario F. Triola - Elementary Statistics

### Computer Science
[Rust book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)
Data structure from coursera and Edx

Not just computer science, but its application in other field.
e.g. computer science application in biology:
Phillip Compeau, Pavel Pevzner - Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach

e.g. In geography
David S. Jordan - Applied Geospatial Data Science with Python, Leverage geospatial data analysis and modeling to find unique solutions to environmental problems-Packt Publishing

### Chemistry
Chemistry A Molecular Approach by Nivaldo J. Tro

### Physics
Conceptual Physics, Global Edition - Paul G. Hewitt
Feynman Lectures On Physics

### Mental Health
Anxiety and Phobia Workbook - Edmund J. Bourne

### Social Sciences
As already recommended, Openstax world history



## We follow slow and steady wins the race

**We follow slow and steady wins the race philosophy, with stretching the time to learn the subjects from 5â€“8 years.** 

[All the books recommended meets the learning strategy for better learning](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/education/features-of-good-books-or-curriculum.html)

Complex subjects often require a deep understanding and the ability to integrate various concepts, which cannot be achieved through rushed or sporadic efforts. By approaching learning in a slow and steady manner, you give yourself the time needed to thoroughly grasp each component of the material.

Learning complicated material gradually allows for the accumulation of knowledge in manageable increments. This method reduces the cognitive load and prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed, which can often occur when trying to absorb too much information at once. Breaking down the material into smaller, more digestible parts and consistently working through them each day enables a more profound comprehension and retention of the subject matter. This approach mirrors the fable of the tortoise and the hare, where the consistent, patient efforts of the tortoise ultimately lead to success.

Moreover, slow and steady learning helps in building a strong foundation. Complicated subjects typically build upon basic principles. By taking the time to master these foundational elements thoroughly, you create a solid base upon which more advanced concepts can be understood more easily. This methodical progression ensures that gaps in knowledge are identified and addressed promptly, preventing future misunderstandings or the need for relearning.

In contrast, attempting to rush through complicated material can lead to superficial learning. This approach often results in a fragile understanding that can easily collapse under the weight of more advanced topics. Procrastination and cramming might yield short-term results, such as passing an exam, but they do not foster long-term retention or the ability to apply knowledge effectively. Therefore, adopting a "slow and steady" approach is not only more sustainable but also more effective in achieving true mastery of complicated subjects.
