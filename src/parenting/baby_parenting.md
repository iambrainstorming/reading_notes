Checklist for what your baby may need:

Here are some other ­reasons why your baby may cry and tips on what you can try to meet that need. If your baby is…

### Hungry. 
Keep track of feeding times and look for early signs of hunger, such as lip-smacking or ­moving fists to his mouth.

### Cold or hot. 
Dress your baby in about the same ­layers of clothing that you are wearing to be comfortable.

### Wet or soiled. 
Check the diaper. In the first few months, babies wet and soil their diapers a lot.

### Spitting up or vomiting a lot. 

Some babies have symptoms from gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and the fussiness can be confused with colic. Contact your child's doctor if your baby is fussy after feeding, has excessive spitting or vomiting, and is losing or not gaining weight.

### Sick (has a fever or other illness). 
Check your baby's temperature. If your baby is younger than 2 months and has a fever, call your child's ­doctor right away. See Fever and Your Baby for more information.

### Overstimulated. 
Try ways to calm your baby mentioned above.

### Bored. 
Quietly sing or hum a song to your baby. Go for a walk.
