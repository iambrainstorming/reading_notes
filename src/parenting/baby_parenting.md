## Amount and Schedule of Baby Formula Feeding

From American Academy of Pediatrics

On average, your baby should take in about 2½ ounces (75 mL) of infant formula a day for every pound (453 g) of body weight.

Checklist for what your baby may need:

Here are some other ­reasons why your baby may cry and tips on what you can try to meet that need. If your baby is…

### Hungry. 
Keep track of feeding times and look for early signs of hunger, such as lip-smacking or ­moving fists to his mouth.

### Cold or hot. 
Dress your baby in about the same ­layers of clothing that you are wearing to be comfortable.

### Wet or soiled. 
Check the diaper. In the first few months, babies wet and soil their diapers a lot.

### Spitting up or vomiting a lot. 

Some babies have symptoms from gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and the fussiness can be confused with colic. Contact your child's doctor if your baby is fussy after feeding, has excessive spitting or vomiting, and is losing or not gaining weight.

### Sick (has a fever or other illness). 
Check your baby's temperature. If your baby is younger than 2 months and has a fever, call your child's ­doctor right away. See Fever and Your Baby for more information.

### Overstimulated. 
Try ways to calm your baby mentioned above.

### Bored. 
Quietly sing or hum a song to your baby. Go for a walk.

## Baby should never be shaken

No matter how impatient or angry you become, [a baby should never be shaken](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Abusive-Head-Trauma-Shaken-Baby-Syndrome.aspx). Shaking an infant hard can cause blindness, brain damage or even death

## The Baby Poop and Urination Guide

[The Baby Poop Guide: What's Normal and What's Not](https://www.parents.com/baby/diapers/dirty/the-scoop-on-poop-whats-normal-whats-not/#toc-how-often-should-my-baby-poop)

The short answer is baby poop that has a green, mustard yellow, or brown color and is soft and grainy is completely normal, but poop that has a white, red, or black color is not.

### Breastfed baby poop frequency  

According to Dr. Pittman, it can be normal for a breastfed baby to have one bowel movement each week—but it's also normal for them to poop after every feeding. (In other words, as long as a breastfed baby is pooping at least once a week, you're probably good.) 

### Formula-fed baby poop frequency 

Formula-fed baby poop is usually different than breastfed baby poop. That's because stool moves through the intestines more slowly with formula, causing babies to go about once or twice per day, every one or two days, after the first couple of months. Note, however, that some formula-fed infants will poop up to three or four times daily at first.

## Breastfeeding

Breast milk is widely recognized as the optimal source of nutrition for infants, providing essential nutrients, antibodies, and [hormones](https://www.verywellfamily.com/hormones-in-breast-milk-3984343) that foster healthy growth and development. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, citing numerous benefits including enhanced [cognitive development](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10500022/), [boosted immune systems](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding-Benefits-Your-Babys-Immune-System.aspx), and a reduced risk of [respiratory](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-019-1693-2) and [ear infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9238244/). 

### Breast Pumping 

However, for mothers who have undergone a cesarean section or those who must return to work, breastfeeding can be a challenge. In such cases, breastpumping milk can be an efficient way to feed breast milk to baby through a bottle, ensuring that they still receive the benefits of breast milk even when direct breastfeeding is not possible. By expressing milk and storing it in a bottle, mothers can maintain their milk supply, alleviate engorgement, and provide their baby with the nourishment they need, even when they are not physically present. This approach also allows partners, caregivers, or family members to participate in feeding, making it a convenient and practical solution for modern families.

### Mother's Health and Breast feeding

Breastfeeding has health benefits for the mother too! Breastfeeding can reduce the mother's risk of breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.

Exclusive breastfeeding for about the first six months is recommended. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends continued breastfeeding while introducing appropriate complementary foods until children are 12 months old or older.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization also recommend exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, with continued breastfeeding along with introducing appropriate complementary foods for up to 2 years of age or longer.
