# Entropy of the universe increases

## Entropy and cell biology
**Entropy** is a concept from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics that refers to the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. In more technical terms, it quantifies the number of microscopic configurations that correspond to a thermodynamic system's macroscopic state. A high entropy state is one with a high degree of disorder and many possible configurations, whereas a low entropy state has more order and fewer configurations. 

In **cell biology**, entropy plays a crucial role in various processes:

1. **Thermodynamic Stability**: Biological systems tend to move towards states of higher entropy. For instance, the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones (catabolism) releases energy and increases the overall entropy of the system.

2. **Protein Folding**: The process by which a protein assumes its functional three-dimensional structure is influenced by entropy. Unfolded proteins have higher entropy because of their disordered state, but they fold into specific structures to perform biological functions, thereby decreasing entropy locally while increasing the entropy of the surroundings.

3. **Membrane Dynamics**: Cell membranes are composed of lipid bilayers, and the arrangement of these molecules can change to maintain the entropy balance. For example, the fluid mosaic model of cell membranes indicates that lipids and proteins move laterally within the layer, contributing to the membrane's dynamic nature and entropy.

4. **Transport Mechanisms**: Entropy is a driving force in passive transport mechanisms, such as diffusion. Molecules move from areas of high concentration (low entropy) to areas of low concentration (high entropy) to achieve equilibrium.

5. **Energy Utilization**: Cellular processes that require energy, like active transport and biosynthesis, often involve a decrease in entropy within the cell. However, the overall entropy of the universe still increases, as these processes release heat and other forms of energy into the environment.

Understanding entropy in the context of cell biology helps in grasping how cells maintain order and function while obeying the fundamental laws of thermodynamics.

## Entropy and Bail curve

The statement "entropy of the universe increases" is a reflection of the second law of thermodynamics, which asserts that in any natural process, the total entropy of an isolated system will tend to increase over time. This principle underlies the inevitable trend towards disorder and randomness in the universe.

When considering efforts to create order, it's important to note that local decreases in entropy (i.e., creating order) are entirely possible and frequently occur. Living organisms, for example, maintain a high degree of order and structure. However, these local decreases in entropy are always accompanied by greater increases in entropy elsewhere, ensuring that the overall entropy of the universe still increases.

**Regarding efforts to bring order:**

1. **Local vs. Global Entropy**: While the universe as a whole tends towards increased entropy, local systems (like cells, organisms, or human societies) can decrease their entropy temporarily by utilizing energy. For example, the human body maintains its ordered state by consuming food, which releases energy and increases entropy in the environment.

2. **Efforts to Create Order**: Efforts to create order, such as organizing societies, developing technologies, or improving infrastructures, are not futile. These actions are part of natural processes where energy is used to create local order at the expense of increasing global entropy.

3. **Bell Curve and Disorder**: The reference to the Bell Curve likely pertains to the distribution of traits, behaviors, or outcomes within a population. It's true that most individuals will follow average patterns, and some degree of disorder is inevitable due to natural variations and the second law of thermodynamics. However, this doesn't mean that efforts to bring about order and improvement are pointless. Many societal advancements have come from the concerted efforts of individuals and groups working against the trend towards disorder.

**In summary:**

- The second law of thermodynamics indicates that while the universe tends towards greater entropy overall, local decreases in entropy are not only possible but essential for life and progress.
- Efforts to create order are meaningful and contribute to the development and maintenance of complex systems, even though they are accompanied by an increase in entropy elsewhere.
- Human efforts to improve and organize societies are valuable, despite the natural tendency towards disorder, and can lead to significant advancements and benefits.


The concept of entropy in physics, particularly in the context of the second law of thermodynamics, states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This principle often translates into the idea that the universe tends toward greater disorder and randomness.

The mention of the Bell Curve, or normal distribution, refers to a statistical distribution where most occurrences take place near the mean or average value, with fewer occurrences happening as you move away from the mean. In this context, it might imply that most people or systems tend to contribute to this overall increase in disorder, rather than decreasing it. 

However, it's important to note that while individual actions might seem to increase disorder, there are many processes and systems (both natural and human-made) that work towards creating order, albeit locally and temporarily. The overall trend in an isolated system like the universe is towards increased entropy, but local decreases in entropy are possible and commonplace.


## Respiration and Photosynthesis
Plants and animals both interact with entropy in different ways, particularly through the processes of photosynthesis and respiration.

### Plants and Photosynthesis:
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process involves taking in carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) and producing glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (O₂). The overall reaction is:

\[ 6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2 \]

During photosynthesis, plants decrease local entropy by converting light energy into a more ordered form of chemical energy stored in glucose. This process builds complex molecules from simpler ones, creating order and reducing entropy locally. However, it is important to note that the overall entropy of the universe still increases because the energy input from the sun (a highly ordered form of energy) is spread out as heat during the process, increasing the overall disorder.

### Animals and Respiration:
Respiration is the process by which animals (and plants at night) convert the chemical energy stored in glucose into usable energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The general reaction for cellular respiration is:

\[ \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy (ATP)} \]

Respiration breaks down complex molecules (glucose) into simpler ones (carbon dioxide and water), releasing energy in the process. This increases local entropy as it turns a more ordered form of chemical energy into a less ordered form, primarily heat and kinetic energy, which dissipates into the environment.

### Summary:
- **Plants (Photosynthesis):** Locally decrease entropy by creating ordered structures (glucose) from less ordered inputs (CO₂ and H₂O), but the overall entropy of the universe increases due to the dispersal of solar energy.
- **Animals (Respiration):** Increase local entropy by breaking down ordered structures (glucose) into less ordered forms (CO₂ and H₂O) and releasing energy, contributing to the overall increase in the universe's entropy.

Both processes are integral to the balance of energy and matter in ecosystems, with photosynthesis capturing and storing energy and respiration releasing it for use by living organisms.

## Explain how plants increase overall entropy. 

Plants increase overall entropy through the process of photosynthesis, even though they locally decrease entropy by creating ordered structures such as glucose. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Photosynthesis and Local Entropy Decrease:
During photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (O₂) using light energy from the sun:

\[ 6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2 \]

This process results in the formation of glucose, a highly ordered and energy-rich molecule, from simpler and less ordered molecules (CO₂ and H₂O). In this sense, photosynthesis decreases local entropy within the plant by organizing molecules into a more complex structure.

### Overall Entropy Increase:
The key to understanding how photosynthesis increases overall entropy lies in the source and transformation of energy:

1. **Energy Input from the Sun:**
   - The light energy that plants use for photosynthesis originates from the sun. This energy is in a highly ordered form, concentrated and coherent.

2. **Energy Transformation and Dispersion:**
   - During photosynthesis, the absorbed light energy is converted into chemical energy stored in glucose. Although this conversion creates order within the plant (decreasing local entropy), the process is not perfectly efficient. Some of the absorbed energy is converted into heat and dissipates into the surroundings.
   - Additionally, the sun itself produces energy through nuclear fusion, a process that significantly increases the entropy of the sun as it converts hydrogen into helium and releases vast amounts of energy into space.

3. **Energy Dispersal:**
   - The heat generated during photosynthesis and the energy radiated by the sun increase the overall entropy of the environment. This energy dispersal contributes to the overall increase in the universe's entropy.

### Thermodynamic Perspective:
From a thermodynamic perspective, while photosynthesis represents a local decrease in entropy within the plant (as it organizes molecules into glucose), the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system, such as the universe, must increase over time. The decrease in entropy within the plant is more than compensated for by the increase in entropy associated with the transformation and dispersal of energy from the sun to the surroundings.

### Summary:
- **Local Entropy Decrease:** Photosynthesis decreases entropy within the plant by creating ordered structures (glucose) from less ordered inputs (CO₂ and H₂O).
- **Overall Entropy Increase:** The process increases the overall entropy of the universe due to the inefficiency of energy conversion, the dispersal of heat, and the entropy increase associated with the sun's energy production and radiation.

In essence, while plants create local pockets of order, the overall effect of photosynthesis and the energy transformations involved contribute to the universe's inevitable trend toward higher entropy.
